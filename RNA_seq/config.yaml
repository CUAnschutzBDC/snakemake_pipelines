# Sample sheet. This is the path to the sample sheet. Should be a tab delimited
# tsv file with the one column titled "sample" and a second column titled
# "fastq1" with filenames relating to each sample. If paired end sequencing was
# done, another columen should be titled "fastq2" with filenames for read 2.
# If spike-ins were included another column can be spike-in with True/False
# values and you must include paths for the COMBINED_GENOME and COMBINED_GTF
SAMPLE_TABLE:
  "files/samples.tsv"

# Project the name of the project
PROJECT:
  "PTPN_KO"

# Reference. This should be the path to a directory created using star
GENOME:
  /beevol/home/rbilab/ref/indices/star/mouse/GRCm38

# Combined genome if spike-ins were used. This should be a path to a combined index using
# star. Can leave blank if no spike-ins were used.
COMBINED_GENOME:

# GTF. This is a path to the gtf file. Should match the genome fa used
GTF:
  /beevol/home/rbilab/ref/annotation/mouse/GRCm38/gtf/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf

# Combined gtf if spike-ins were used. Should match the genome fa used.
# Can leave blank if no spike-ins were used.
COMBINED_GTF:

# Path to results directory
RESULTS:
  "results"

# Path to adaptors file. This is included in the bbtools package under .../bbmap/resources/adaptors.fa
# Not necessary if not using bbduk for trimming
ADAPTORS:


# Trim method, can be "bbduk", "cutadapt", or "no"
TRIM_METHOD:
  "cutadapt"

# Parameters for paired end or single end experiments
