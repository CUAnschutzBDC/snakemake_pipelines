RAW_DATA:

# The path to the aws download (find from the geo site, will run wget and expects

# A list of sample names. This will be the name of the output folder. All sample

# Sample names separated by groups to aggregate. If no samples to aggregate,

AGGR_SAMPLES:

# Sample names for gene expression fastqs. If the same libraries were
# sequenced multiple times, just include all the fastq directories in the
# RAW_DATA list and make sure the fastqs from all runs begin with the
# sample name. Only fastqs that begin with the sample name will be 
# included in the analysis. Leave blank if downloading.
RNA_SAMPLES:


# Sample names for CITE-seq and cell hashing fastqs. If 
# the libraries were sequenced multiple times, just make sure the fastqs 
# from all runs begin with the sample name. If CITE-seq or cell hashing 
# was not performed, leave this blank. If you have CITE-seq on only a
# a subset of samples, keep the slot empty (ex. - "")

# Sample names for VDJ fastqs. Follow the same parameters required for gene
# expression fastqs. If VDJ sequencing was not performed, leave this blank.
