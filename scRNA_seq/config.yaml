# Path to the fastq directory, multiple directories can be given.
RAW_DATA:
    - "raw_data/run_1"
    - "raw_data/run_2"

# A list of sample names. This will be the name of the output folder. All sample 
# names must be unique. There must be the same number of sample names as RNA_samples
# below.
SAMPLES:
    - "scSample_run_1"
    - "scSample_run_2"

# Sample names separated by groups to aggregate. If no samples to aggregate,
# leave this blank. Structure is as follows:
# AGGR_SAMPLES:
#   GROUP_NAME:
#      - "samplex"...
AGGR_SAMPLES:

# Sample names for gene expression fastqs. If the same libraries were
# sequenced multiple times, just include all the fastq directories in the
# RAW_DATA list and make sure the fastqs from all runs begin with the
# sample name. Only fastqs that begin with the sample name will be 
# included in the analysis.
RNA_SAMPLES:
    - "scSample_GEX"
    - "scSample_GEX"

# Sample names for CITE-seq and cell hashing fastqs. If 
# the libraries were sequenced multiple times, just make sure the fastqs 
# from all runs begin with the sample name. If CITE-seq or cell hashing 
# was not performed, leave this blank. If you have CITE-seq on only a
# a subset of samples, keep the slot empty (ex. - "")
ADT_SAMPLES:
    - "scSample_FB"
    - "scSample_FB"

# Sample names for TCR VDJ fastqs. Follow the same parameters required for gene
# expression fastqs. If VDJ sequencing was not performed, leave this blank.
VDJ_T_SAMPLES:
    - "scSample_TCR"
    - "scSample_TCR"

# Sample names for BCR VDJ fastqs. Follow the same parameters required for gene
# expression fastqs. If VDJ sequencing was not performed, leave this blank.
VDJ_B_SAMPLES:
    - "scSample_BCR"
    - "scSample_BCR"

# Path to the output directory.
RESULTS:
    "results"

# Path to the Cell Ranger genome reference.
GENOME:

# and barcode. If CITE-seq or cell hashing was not performed, leave this 
# blank.
