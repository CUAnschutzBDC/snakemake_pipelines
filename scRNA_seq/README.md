# Single cell RNA-seq of thymic organiods

## Aims
1. Characterize cell types present in stem cell derived organotypic thymic culture system (STOC). Cells from the STOC will be isolated and sequenced using the 10x
Genomics platform. Single-cell cell hastagging, antibody capture, VDJ, and RNA will be combined to characterize the cells within the STOC.
2. Characterize TRA expression and Aire expression in the STOC following treatment with anti-RANK ligand. Anti-RANK ligand has been shown to specifically
decrease the AIRE expressing cells in the thymus, allowing for an exploration of the thymus without the AIRE producing cells.
